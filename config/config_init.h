 * designed to be easily changed because of the code makes assumptions about
 * them. Because of that, those constants are hard-coded and not available as
 * CMake variables. With time, some of those constants get "promoted" and moved
 * in CMake, others remain here. See the comments and think about the potential
 * implications before promoting a hard-coded constant to a configurable CMake
