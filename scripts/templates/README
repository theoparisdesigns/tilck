This directory (and all of its subdirectories) does NOT contain directly
runnable scripts. Instead, it contains template scripts which are "patched"
by CMake with the right paths, config values etc. Their correspondent
runnable scripts are emitted in project's build directory after running
CMake (or our 'cmake_run' wrapper).
