#
# These "scripts" are NOT meant to be executed directly. They are included as
# source files by the scripts/build_toolchian script.
#
# Each one of them, contains one or more "functions" that build or download
# an external component (e.g. busybox). The user can "install" that component
# in the toolchain by running the `build_toolchian` script with the `-s` option.
#
# N.B.: every line in this text file begins with '#' because all the files in
# this directory are treated as bash source files by `build_toolchian`.
