In order to allow Tilck's gdb script to work, add the following twos lines in
your gdbinit file (typically ~/.gdbinit):

   set print pretty on
   add-auto-load-safe-path <ABSOLUTE-PATH-OF-TILCK-BUILD-DIRECTORY>

Without the first line, the pretty printers will display the objects in an ugly
way, especially because of the padding used to align all the fields.

The second line is required because GDB's security protection. Without it,
the scripts won't be loaded and you'll see GDB complaining like:

Reading symbols from ./build/tilck_unstripped...
warning: File "/home/vlad/dev/tilck/build/tilck_unstripped-gdb.py" auto-loading has been declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set to "$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load".
To enable execution of this file add
	add-auto-load-safe-path /home/vlad/dev/tilck/build/tilck_unstripped-gdb.py
line to your configuration file "/home/vlad/.gdbinit".
To completely disable this security protection add
	set auto-load safe-path /
line to your configuration file "/home/vlad/.gdbinit".
For more information about this security protection see the
"Auto-loading safe path" section in the GDB manual.  E.g., run from the shell:
	info "(gdb)Auto-loading safe path"
